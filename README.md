## üéØ Project Overview

Living Book Engine v2 is a **Revolutionary Content Generation System** that fundamentally disrupts traditional publishing industry conventions. Unlike conventional content platforms, this system is designed to generate cognitively dissonant, paradigm-shifting content that forces readers to question industry dogma and transform their worldview.

### üî• Revolutionary Principles

- **Industry Convention Destruction**: Systematic negation of established publishing practices
- **Cognitive Dissonance Generation**: Intentional reader discomfort for transformation
- **Contrarian Truth Construction**: Revolutionary perspective development
- **Human-Indistinguishable Output**: Advanced AI detection prevention
- **Expert Backlash Generation**: Professional criticism as success validation

### üéØ Core Components

- **`revolutionary-content-engine.js`**: Industry consensus analysis and destruction algorithms
- **`revolutionary-book-generator.js`**: Complete automated book generation orchestration
- **`quick-revolutionary-test.js`**: Rapid testing and validation framework
- **`gemini-api-service.js`**: AI service with dynamic model selection (2.5-pro/flash)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the revolutionary repository
git clone https://github.com/boxi-rgb/living-book-engine-v2.git
cd living-book-engine-v2

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

### 2. Revolutionary Content Generation
```bash
# Quick revolutionary test (recommended for first use)
npm run quick-revolution

# Industry-specific destruction modes
npm run destroy-selfhelp     # Self-help industry complete destruction
npm run destroy-business     # Business convention annihilation
npm run destroy-tech         # Technology trend contrarian analysis

# Full revolutionary book generation
npm run revolution
```

### 3. Quality Validation
```bash
# Code quality gates
npm run lint                 # ESLint enforcement
npm run format              # Prettier formatting
npm run quality-gate        # Complete validation pipeline
```

## üìä Revolutionary Quality Standards

The system enforces **5-dimensional revolutionary scoring** with minimum thresholds:

| Dimension | Target | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Paradigm Destruction** | 90+/100 | Industry convention breaking effectiveness |
| **Cognitive Dissonance** | 85+/100 | Reader discomfort and questioning generation |
| **Industry Differentiation** | 95+/100 | Uniqueness from conventional approaches |
| **Truth Excavation Depth** | 92+/100 | Non-obvious insight discovery |
| **Transformational Catalyst** | 88+/100 | Reader worldview change potential |

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Basic Revolutionary Generation
```bash
